# Longest Increasing Subsequence Dynamic Programming

## Problem Statement

Given an array or list of n integers, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence. The array could include positive and negative integers.

## Approach

The algorithm to solve the problem has been implemented in three ways:

- recursive
- top-down
- bottom-up (Dynamic Programming)

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the dynamic programming solution is: O(N^2)
